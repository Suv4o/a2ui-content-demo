# Startup Funding 101

Understanding how to fund your startup is crucial for turning your idea into a thriving business. This guide breaks down the funding landscape for first-time founders.

## The Funding Journey

Most startups go through several funding stages, each with different characteristics:

1. **Pre-seed** - Initial capital from founders, friends, family
2. **Seed** - First external funding, typically $500K-$2M
3. **Series A** - Scaling proven business model, $2M-$15M
4. **Series B+** - Rapid expansion and market dominance

## Types of Investors

| Investor Type   | Check Size | What They Offer                    |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Angel Investors | $25K-$100K | Mentorship, connections            |
| Venture Capital | $1M-$50M+  | Capital, strategic guidance        |
| Accelerators    | $50K-$500K | Program, network, credibility      |

## Preparing Your Pitch

Your pitch deck should include:

-   **Problem** - What pain point are you solving?
-   **Solution** - Your unique approach
-   **Market Size** - How big is the opportunity?
-   **Business Model** - How will you make money?
-   **Traction** - What have you achieved so far?
-   **Team** - Why are you the right people?
-   **Ask** - How much and what will you do with it?

## Key Metrics Investors Look For

### For B2B SaaS

-   Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
-   Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
-   Lifetime Value (LTV)
-   Churn Rate
-   Net Revenue Retention

### For Consumer Apps

-   Daily/Monthly Active Users
-   User Growth Rate
-   Engagement Metrics
-   Viral Coefficient
-   Retention Curves

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overvaluing your company** - Be realistic about your stage
2. **Ignoring dilution** - Understand how funding affects ownership
3. **Taking bad money** - Not all investors are equal
4. **Waiting too long** - Fundraising takes 3-6 months typically
5. **Neglecting legal** - Get proper legal counsel

## Alternative Funding Options

Not ready for VC funding? Consider:

-   **Bootstrapping** - Self-fund and grow organically
-   **Revenue-based financing** - Pay back from future revenue
-   **Grants** - Non-dilutive government or foundation money
-   **Strategic partnerships** - Get funded by potential customers

> Remember: The best source of capital is often paying customers!
