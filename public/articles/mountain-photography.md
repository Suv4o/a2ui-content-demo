## Essential Gear

-   Wide-angle lens (16-35mm)
-   Sturdy tripod
-   ND filters for long exposures
-   Extra batteries (cold drains them fast!)

## Best Times to Shoot

### Golden Hour

The hour after sunrise and before sunset offers warm, directional light that accentuates textures and creates depth.

### Blue Hour

The twilight period produces moody, atmospheric shots with cool tones.

### Night Sky

Clear mountain nights reveal stunning Milky Way opportunities.

## Composition Tips

1. **Use leading lines** - Trails, ridges, and rivers guide the eye
2. **Include foreground interest** - Rocks, flowers, or reflections add depth
3. **Rule of thirds** - Place peaks off-center for dynamic compositions
4. **Frame within frames** - Use trees or rock formations as natural borders

## Safety First

> Never prioritize a shot over your safety. Mountains demand respect.

Always check weather conditions, inform others of your plans, and carry emergency supplies.
