# Healthy Eating for Busy People

Maintaining a nutritious diet doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. Here's your practical guide to eating well, even with a packed schedule.

## The Foundation: Meal Prep Basics

Spending just 2-3 hours on Sunday can transform your entire week. The key is to prepare versatile ingredients that can be mixed and matched.

### Essential Prep Items

-   Grilled chicken breasts or tofu
-   Roasted vegetables (broccoli, sweet potatoes, bell peppers)
-   Cooked grains (quinoa, brown rice, farro)
-   Washed and chopped salad greens
-   Hard-boiled eggs

## Quick & Healthy Breakfast Ideas

| Meal                 | Prep Time | Nutrition Highlights   |
| -------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| Overnight oats       | 5 min     | Fiber, complex carbs   |
| Greek yogurt parfait | 3 min     | Protein, probiotics    |
| Smoothie bowl        | 5 min     | Vitamins, antioxidants |
| Avocado toast        | 4 min     | Healthy fats, fiber    |

## Smart Snacking

> "The best snack is one that combines protein and fiber to keep you satisfied until your next meal."

Keep these healthy snacks at your desk:

1. **Nuts and seeds** - A handful provides lasting energy
2. **Fresh fruit** - Natural sugars without the crash
3. **Hummus and veggies** - Protein-packed and satisfying
4. **Greek yogurt** - High protein, gut-friendly

## Hydration Matters

Don't forget about water! Aim for 8 glasses daily. Signs you might need more:

-   Afternoon fatigue
-   Headaches
-   Difficulty concentrating
-   Dry skin

## The 80/20 Rule

Eat nutritious foods 80% of the time, and allow yourself treats 20% of the time. This sustainable approach prevents burnout and keeps you on track long-term.

> Remember: Progress, not perfection, is the goal.
